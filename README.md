# Interactive-Form
Third techdegree project where i created a form with some interactive elements.
Added Real-time error message and Conditional error message for the email input.
If email is empty hint says "Must provide an email",
if its not a .com it says "must be a .com address"
otherwise it says "needs to be properly formatted".
